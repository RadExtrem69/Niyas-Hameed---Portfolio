            <p>Welcome to my online persona! 
                <br>
                <br>
                My alias is Rad, and many internet people know me by that. I’m a discord moderator, YouTuber, Twitch streamer and Redditor. Though, I might not be most active in these platforms nowadays. Besides, I’m working on building myself for the corporate, and I must say. It feels good to sometimes take time off.</p>
                <p>I’m currently playing DJMAX-RESPECT V, a rhythm game, which is quite challenging. It’s a game where you tap on keys with sync to the beat. I even made a website featuring DJMAX. I’m also a former Osu! Player, so you might’ve heard of my username from over there. You’ll find a deep description of my online activities and achievements in the below topics.</p>

            <h2>Discord Moderator (2018 - 2021)</h2>
            <h3>TheTekkitRealm, YouTube</h3>
            <p>Worked with a team of 5 on moderating the official Discord server for TheTekkitRealm, a.k.a Infurness. The target audience to his YouTube channel was around the ages from 10-19, so it was quite challenging to handle the fans and his community. Learnt how to keep things in control, and social moderation, solving issues when people get harrased or feel offended and stuff. There were over 3000 People in the server by the time i quit moderation.</p>
            <h2>Discord Moderator (2019)</h2>
            <h3>iLoveFriday, YouTube</h3>
            <p>Worked on moderation of iLoveFriday’s official Discord Server, iLoveFriday was a YouTube craze back in the 2018-2019 shift. The famous “Hit or Miss” meme made them really popular, and they decided to make a discord server. I requested the team for getting me into moderation. It was a tough experience, as it was overwhelming, having 4000-5000 people in a single server, and monitoring every message.</p>

            <h3>RadExtrem, Camargo Weaver</h3>
            <p>Started my YouTube journey back in 2014. My accounts got erased due to copyright issues and i had to restart from scratch. My channel recieved an okayish- amount of support from my friends and family, because all I uploaded was gameplay videos and memes. They particularly lost interest in a year, and all my viewers are from the Phillipines, US and the UK (100K in total). Currently, I upload in a channel called Camargo Weaver, where I post gameplay clips from my Twitch.</p>

            <h3>radextrem</h3>
            <p>Started streaming on Twitch after i got my new PC, which was capable of providing smooth gaming experiences. I had a tough time gaining viewers, but I got used to the grind and started streaming whenver I could. I currently have 322.5 hours on streaming and have over 50 followers, which is pretty average. But oftentimes, I get to interact with thoughtful viewers and random people.</p>
